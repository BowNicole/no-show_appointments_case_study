No Show Appointment Data Case Study

The case study focuses on patient data from some hospitals/clinics in Brazil.

The data has been provided and you can feel free to use it for your won analsysis or to follow along tthe case study.

I used the latest Jupyter notebook for my analysis, along with `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn` and `matplotlib` packages
for the wrangling and visualisations.

Feel free to take a look and if you have any questions or feedback, don't be shy!
